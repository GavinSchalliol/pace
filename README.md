# pace
Pace is a registration and management application for running events and competitions.i

## Dev Setup
Pace is currently based on [express.js](http://expressjs.com/) and [node](https://nodejs.org), therefore you will need both on
your machine. To install node, go either to https://nodejs.org/ or if you are using a mac & brew use the following cmd: `brew install node`. To get all the other dependencies and be able to start **pace** locally, just navigate to the pace folder and run `npm install`

### Starting
Just run `npm start` and open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
